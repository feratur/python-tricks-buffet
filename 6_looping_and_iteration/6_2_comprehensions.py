    # Comprehensions are a key feature in Python.
    # Understanding and applying them will make your code much more Pythonic.
    #
    # Comprehensions are just fancy syntactic sugar for a simple for-loop pattern.
    # Once you understand the pattern, youâ€™ll develop an intuitive understanding for comprehensions.
    #
    # There are more than just list comprehensions.
